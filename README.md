### Playlist generator based on user's mood

The app was built as a group project. It generates music playlist based on user's mood. The mood is detected via face recogniton but it can also be adjusted manually.

It uses Spotify API to select songs from the playlist that user has already saved on Spotify. The face recogniton is done via Azure API.
